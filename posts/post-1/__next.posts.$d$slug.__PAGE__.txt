3:T9b1,<h2>Who Cares?</h2>
<p><em><strong>Companies do not care about your privacy.</strong></em></p>
<p>Shocking right? Of course not, your entire digital footprint is being sold to advertisers to sell you products and services you most likely do not need.</p>
<p>For me these products are mostly software based application that utilize a subscription fee to keep me using their bogus app, when in reality the issue has always been mental.</p>
<p>If I had half a brain and arguably less of a heart I'd be using this information to my advantage, creating another bullshit dating app, or habit tracking app, selling a course or two in the case of cybersecurity and not have to actually hack or study anything. Use AI workflows to scrape the web or spam for whatever information I could sell to make a buck.</p>
<p>Ultimately you are just a product in the eyes of companies, which for many its fine. Numerous times people have told me they don't give a crap about privacy notibly stating that they (the companies) already have all that information anyways and as much as it pains me to say this... They're right.</p>
<h2>The cost of privacy.</h2>
<p>It's baffling when some say,
"If you have nothing to hide your privacy shouldn't matter."</p>
<p>Personally I am under the impression that I should not any of my rights infringed upon because of the actions of a few bad actors. I believe in privacy, freedom of speech, and the right to be left alone.</p>
<p>I'd prefer not to have my data used to market, influence, and control those of us who are more trusting in the powers that may be. For once I wish to not have assassinations broadcasted widespread or to wake up to see another war break out on my timeline. Naive of me, possibly.</p>
<p>As long as I am not harming anyone or breaking any laws, I should be able to live my life as I see fit without the prying eyes of corporations and governments looking over my shoulder.
Probably sound a bit wacko, but I'd rather be skeptical than complacent in this case.</p>
<p>Long story short,your data is probably being used, sold, and manipulated in ways you may not even be aware of.
I choose to arm myself with a wealth of knowledge to prepare for the worst especially in this era. I choose not to be manipulated. I will be free.</p>
<p>Knowledge is power, never stop learning and your efforts will be rewarded.</p>
