## Who Cares?
***Companies do not care about your privacy.***

Shocking right? Of course not, your entire digital footprint is being sold to advertisers to sell you products and services you most likely do not need. 

For me these products are mostly software based application that utilize a subscription fee to keep me using their bogus app, when in reality the issue has always been mental.

If I had half a brain and arguably less of a heart I'd be using this information to my advantage, creating another bullshit dating app, or habit tracking app, selling a course or two in the case of cybersecurity and not have to actually hack or study anything. Use AI workflows to scrape the web or spam for whatever information I could sell to make a buck.

Ultimately you are just a product in the eyes of companies, which for many its fine. Numerous times people have told me they don't give a crap about privacy notibly stating that they (the companies) already have all that information anyways and as much as it pains me to say this... They're right.

## The cost of privacy.

It's baffling when some say, 
"If you have nothing to hide your privacy shouldn't matter."

Personally I am under the impression that I should not any of my rights infringed upon because of the actions of a few bad actors. I believe in privacy, freedom of speech, and the right to be left alone.

 I'd prefer not to have my data used to market, influence, and control those of us who are more trusting in the powers that may be. For once I wish to not have assassinations broadcasted widespread or to wake up to see another war break out on my timeline. Naive of me, possibly.

As long as I am not harming anyone or breaking any laws, I should be able to live my life as I see fit without the prying eyes of corporations and governments looking over my shoulder.
Probably sound a bit wacko, but I'd rather be skeptical than complacent in this case.

Long story short,your data is probably being used, sold, and manipulated in ways you may not even be aware of. 
I choose to arm myself with a wealth of knowledge to prepare for the worst especially in this era. I choose not to be manipulated. I will be free.

Knowledge is power, never stop learning and your efforts will be rewarded.
